###Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a freshman software engineering major at [UCI](https://uci.edu/). \n
I'm currently **starting** my programming journey. A goal I'm working towards is starting my first project. I'm currently learning web development. I don't know if I want to focus on web development but I am currently just trying to learning anything right now.
